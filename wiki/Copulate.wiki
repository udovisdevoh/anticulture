==Effects of male-female copulation==
===Orgasm===
When two individuals of diffrent sex copulate, the male's [MaleOrgasm] [NeedStat need] is largely decreased while the female's [FemaleOrgasm] [NeedStat need] is decreased too.

===Creation of a new entity===
A new individual is created by randomly selecting [Gene genes] from the parents and by randomly mutating them. The [NeedStat need] [Gene genes] are then [Normalization normalized].

===Pregnancy===
The female becomes pregnant and carries the new [Entity entity].

===Child Birth===
After some time, the new entity is free and the mother's [ChildBirth] [NeedStat need] is decreased.

==Effects same sex copulation==
When two female individuals copulate, their [MaleOrgasm] or [FemaleOrgasm] [NeedStat need] is slightly decreased.
