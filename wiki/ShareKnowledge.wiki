#summary ShareKnowledge is part of the AntiCultureWorld project.

ShareKnowledge is an [Operator operator]. It sends a [meme] into another individual's [culture].


=Selection of best meme=
==Random procedure==
There should be XX% chances of using the best meme. If not, there should be XX% chances of using the 2nd best meme. We could eventually put the XX constant into a [Metagene metagene].

==Finding something original==
The person sharing knowledge could also find the best [meme] to share by looking at the other person's [culture]. The speaking person would then ignore his best meme and pick the next one if the person recieving the meme's best meme is the same as the person speaking.
