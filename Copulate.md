When two individuals of diffrent sex copulate, the male's [MaleOrgasm](MaleOrgasm.md) [need](NeedStat.md) is largely decreased while the female's [FemaleOrgasm](FemaleOrgasm.md) [need](NeedStat.md) is decreased too.

### Creation of a new entity ###
A new individual is created by randomly selecting [genes](Gene.md) from the parents and by randomly mutating them. The [need](NeedStat.md) [genes](Gene.md) are then [normalized](Normalization.md).

### Pregnancy ###
The female becomes pregnant and carries the new [entity](Entity.md).

### Child Birth ###
After some time, the new entity is free and the mother's [ChildBirth](ChildBirth.md) [need](NeedStat.md) is decreased.

## Effects same sex copulation ##
When two female individuals copulate, their [MaleOrgasm](MaleOrgasm.md) or [FemaleOrgasm](FemaleOrgasm.md) [need](NeedStat.md) is slightly decreased.
